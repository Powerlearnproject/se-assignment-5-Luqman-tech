   - Outline the steps to set up and start debugging a simple program in VS Code. What are some key debugging features available in VS Code?

   Setting up and starting debugging in Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a straightforward process. Here’s an outline of the steps to debug a simple program and a summary of key debugging features available in VS Code.

-Steps to Set Up and Start Debugging

Step 1: Install Necessary Extensions
-Language Support: Ensure you have the appropriate language extension installed. For example, for JavaScript/TypeScript, install the "JavaScript (ES6) code snippets" extension, and for Python, install the "Python" extension by Microsoft.

Step 2: Open Your Project
- Open the folder containing your project by going to `File` > `Open Folder` or using `Ctrl+K Ctrl+O`.

Step 3: Create a Sample Program
- Create a simple program file. For example, in JavaScript, create a file named `app.js`:
  ```javascript
  console.log("Hello, World!");
  ```

Step 4: Configure Debugger
 1.Open the Run and Debug View:
   - Click the Run and Debug icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window.
   - Or use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+Shift+D`.

 2.Create a Launch Configuration:
   - Click the gear icon to create a `launch.json` file.
   - Select the environment that matches your language (e.g., Node.js for JavaScript).

   For a simple Node.js application, your `launch.json` might look like this:
   ```json
   {
     "version": "0.2.0",
     "configurations": [
       {
         "type": "node",
         "request": "launch",
         "name": "Launch Program",
         "program": "${workspaceFolder}/app.js"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

 Step 5: Set Breakpoints
- Open your source code file (e.g., `app.js`).
- Click in the left margin next to the line numbers where you want to set a breakpoint. A red dot will appear indicating the breakpoint.

 Step 6: Start Debugging
- Go to the Run and Debug view.
- Select the configuration you created (e.g., "Launch Program").
- Click the green play button or press `F5` to start debugging.

 -Key Debugging Features in VS Code

 1.Breakpoints:
   -Set Breakpoints: Click in the margin to set or remove breakpoints.
   -Conditional Breakpoints: Right-click a breakpoint and set conditions under which the breakpoint will be hit.

 2.Watch Variables:
   - Add expressions to the Watch panel to monitor their values over time.

 3.Call Stack:
   - View the call stack to understand the sequence of function calls that led to the current point in the program.

 4.Step Through Code:
   -Continue: Resume program execution until the next breakpoint (`F5`).
   -Step Over: Execute the next line of code but don't step into functions (`F10`).
   -Step Into: Step into functions to debug inside them (`F11`).
   -Step Out: Step out of the current function back to the calling function (`Shift+F11`).

 5.Variables:
   - View and modify variables in the VARIABLES panel to inspect their current values and change them on the fly.

 6.Debug Console:
   - Execute arbitrary commands and evaluate expressions within the context of the debugged program.

 7.Inline Values:
   - See variable values inline with the code during debugging.

 8.Hover:
   - Hover over variables to see their values without opening the VARIABLES panel.

 -Example: Debugging a Simple Node.js Program

 1.Create a `launch.json` Configuration:
   ```json
   {
     "version": "0.2.0",
     "configurations": [
       {
         "type": "node",
         "request": "launch",
         "name": "Launch Program",
         "program": "${workspaceFolder}/app.js"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

 2.Set Breakpoints in `app.js`:
   ```javascript
   console.log("Hello, World!");
   let x = 5;
   console.log("The value of x is:", x);
   ```

 3.Start Debugging:
   - Press `F5` to start debugging.
   - The program will pause at the first breakpoint, allowing you to inspect variables, step through code, and more.
